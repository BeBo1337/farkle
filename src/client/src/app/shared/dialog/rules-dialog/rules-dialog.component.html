  <h3 class="text-center"><u class="bust">Bust</u></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    If at any point in your turn you roll a throw with no available "legal"
    moves you lose all the points you accumulated during your current turn and
    the turn will proceed to the next player
  </p>
  <br /><br />

  <div fxLayout="column" fxLayoutGap="5px">
    <h3 class="text-center"><u>Joker</u></h3>
    <div fxFlex fxLayout="row" fxLayoutAlign="center center">
      <app-die-score [dieFace]="1" [joker]="true"></app-die-score>
      <app-die-score [dieFace]="2" [joker]="true"></app-die-score>
      <app-die-score [dieFace]="3" [joker]="true"></app-die-score>
      <app-die-score [dieFace]="4" [joker]="true"></app-die-score>
      <app-die-score [dieFace]="5" [joker]="true"></app-die-score>
      <app-die-score [dieFace]="6" [joker]="true"></app-die-score>
    </div>
  </div>
  <br />
  <p>
    One die out of the 6 is a joker die - the value 1 on that die is replaced by
    the joker, other values on that die behaves the same as the others.<br />
    if you get a joker - it will automatically change to a number that will
    maximize your point output (it will also change in order to "legalize" the
    move)
  </p>
  <br /><br />
  <h3 class="text-center"><u>Confirmation</u></h3>
  <p>
    When you "confirm" a throw with a die/dice you gain the points they are
    worth and not throw them again for that turn, now you can choose to either
    roll another throw with the remaining dice you have or to stop your turn and
    bank the points you gathered in this turn and the turn will proceed to the
    next player
  </p>
  <br /><br />
  <h3 class="text-center"><u>Turn Completion</u></h3>
  <p>
    If you are able to pickup all the dice during your turn you can choose to
    continue throwing with all the 6 dice becoming available again (essentially
    starting another fresh turn with all the points you gathered up to now) -
    Beware that you may still get a bust at any point during your turn!
  </p>
  <br /><br />

  GOOD LUCK!
